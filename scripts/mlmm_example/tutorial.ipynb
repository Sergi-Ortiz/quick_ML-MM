    "    - `mlmm 1_opt.yaml > 1_opt.log &` from the base directory containing all yaml scripts, coords and prms. The output of all data is contained to `dump`. \n",
    "    - `python opt.py -f <frame number>` to use opt.py. This method uses ASE and requires a directory called `src` with coord and prms. TODO do the same tree file organization as with pysispus. \n",
    "    - Comentar tots els paràmetres detalladament del yaml y les opcions a opt.py\n",
    "    - When finished, do `xyz_geom2pdb -i coord/1_opt_final_geometry.xyz -o coord/1_opt_final_geometry.pdb -r ./parm/complex.pdb` to obtain the pdb from the xyz. \n",

    "2. Perform a bond scan. `bond_scan 2_scan.yaml`, or else to obtain tentative reactant and product structures. After the optimizations are finished, the trajectory file in dump must be converted to pdb for visualization via `xyz_geom2pdb -i final_geometries.trj -o scan_path.pdb -r ../../parm/complex.pdb`. This command must be executed where the trj file is. \n",

Do `xyz_geom2pdb -i coord/3_opt_final_geometry.xyz -o coord/3_opt_final_geometry.pdb -r ./parm/complex.pdb` and `xyz_geom2pdb -i coord/4_opt_final_geometry.xyz -o coord/4_opt_final_geometry.pdb -r ./parm/complex.pdb` to obtain and visualize the pdbs. \n",

    "4. GSM. This steps is very RAM heavy. It performs a SGM-DE from the two stationary points. use `xyz_geom2pdb -i coord/5_gs_peak.xyz -o coord/5_gs_peak.pdb -r ./parm/complex.pdb`. After that, go to dump/gs and run `trj2fig -i current_geometries.trj -o gs.csv --output-peak 5_gs_peak.xyz` to extract eh highest energy node and the csv energy profile. Visualize the pseudo-TS with `xyz_geom2pdb -i coord/5_gs_peak.xyz -o coord/5_gs_peak.pdb -r ./parm/complex.pdb`\n",
